# Overview
Yeah gidday.<br>
<br>
Thought I'd make a quick and easy way for folk to ensure their Diablo 2 Resurrected game saves are saved to the cloud instead of local only.<br>
This script works by copying your save game data to a cloud sync'd location (OneDrive/Dropbox/Google Drive) and creating a Junction in the original location so the game still thinks the files are in the same location.<br>

# Usage
1. Download script
2. Run Script.
3. Begin sighing in relief instead of crying in disbelief in the instance your files get corrupted.
